    "Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\n",
    "nothing to commit, working directory clean\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output tells us two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `On branch master` ‚Äì this tells us that Git is on the `master` branch. You've got a description of a branch on your terms sheet so this is the \"master\" branch (which is the default branch). We'll be looking more at branches in lesson 5\n",
    "2. `Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'`. ‚Äì Because `git clone` was used to copy this repository from another computer, this is telling us if our project is in sync with the one we copied from. We won't be dealing with the project on the other computer, so this line can be ignored.\n",
    "3. `nothing to commit, working directory clean` ‚Äì this is saying that there are no pending changes.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Do** <br/>\n",
    "* do keep the message **short** (less than 60-ish characters)\n",
    "* do explain **what** the commit does (not how or why!)\n",

    "    \n",
    "**Tip:**<br/>\n",

    "The `git diff` command can be used to see changes that have been made but haven't been committed, yet.\n",
    "It's the same output that we say with `git log -p`. Actually `git log -p` uses `git diff` under the hood.<br/><br/>\n",
    "To recap, the `git diff` command is used to see changes that have been made but haven't been committed, yet:\n",

    "### Having Git Ignore Files\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to keep a file in your project's directory structure but make sure it isn't accidentally committed to the project, you can use the specially named file, `.gitignore`(note the dot at the front, it's important!). Add this file to your project in the same directory that the hidden `.git` directory is located.<br/><br/>\n",
    "All you have to do is list the _names_ of files that you want Git to ignore (not track) in the `.gitignore` file and it will ignore them.<br/><br/>\n",
    "When you add a file to `.gitignore` and run `git status`, the `.gitignore` file will be shown as changed, therefore we perform the same steps to commit it to the project.<br/><br/>\n",
    "#### Globing\n",
    "Globbing lets you use special characters to match patterns/characters. In the .gitignore file, you can use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "blank lines can be used for spacing\n",
    "* **\\#** - marks line as a comment\n",
    "* **\\*** - matches 0 or more characters\n",
    "* **?** - matches 1 character\n",
    "* **[abc]** - matches a, b, _or_ c\n",
    "* **\\*\\*** - matches nested directories - a/\\*\\*/z matches\n",
    "    * a/z\n",
    "    * a/b/z\n",
    "    * a/b/c/z\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you have 50 JPEG images in the \"samples\" folder but don't want them to be added to the project, we could add the following line to `.gitignore` to have Git ignore all 50 images.\n",

    "### Tagging\n",
    "The command we'll be using to interact with the repository's tags is the git tag command: \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git tag -a v1.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "**CAREFUL:** In the command above (`git tag -a v1.0`) the `-a` flag is used. This flag tells Git to create an *annotated flag*. If you don't provide the flag (i.e. `git tag v1.0`) then it'll create what's called a *lightweight tag*.<br/><br/>\n",
    "Annotated tags are recommended because they include a lot of extra information such as:\n",
    "* the person who made the tag\n",
    "* the date the tag was made\n",
    "* a message for the tag\n",
    "> Because of this, you should **always use annotated tags**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verify Tag\n",
    "\n",

    "![image-2.png](attachment:image-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `git branch` command\n",
    "The `git branch` command is used to interact with Git's branches. It can be used to:\n",
    "* list all branch names in the repository\n",
    "* create new branches\n",
    "* delete branches\n",
    "\n",
    "If we type out just `git branch` it will list out the branches in a repository:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "DTI Digital@DCPVICTORPONTELLO MINGW64 ~/repos/new_git_course (master)\n",
    "git branch\n",
    "\n",
    "* master\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Create A Branch\n",
    "To create a branch, all you have to do is use git branch and provide it the name of the branch you want it to create. So if you want a branch called \"sidebar\", you'd run this command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git branch <branch-name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "E.g.: If we want to create a branch to the repository which is called *sidebar*, we run the command `git checkout sidebar`. After that we can check the available branches in the repository by running `git branch`. This gives the following output: \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "DTI Digital@DCPVICTORPONTELLO MINGW64 ~/repos/new_git_course (master)\n",
    "git branch\n",
    "\n",
    "* master\n",
    "  sidebar\n",
    "```\n",
    ">This command just creates a new branch, as the \\* before *master* indicates. After running it we do not automatically switch to the new branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The new branch is based on the actual branch, that means that the new fork between the branches starts at the point where the new branch is created (in this case the new branch is a sort of \"copy\" of the master branch)\n",
    "\n",
    "To crate a new branch pointed to some specific former commit, we just have to add the SHA after the command as follows:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git branch <branch-name> <SHA>\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### The `git checkout` Command\n",
    "The `git checkout` command is used to switch between branches. Therefore, to switch to the *sidebar* branch we run the command: \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout sidebar\n",
    "```\n",
    "It's important to understand how this command works. Running this command will:\n",
    "* remove all files and directories from the Working Directory that Git is tracking (files that Git tracks are stored in the repository, so nothing is lost)\n",
    "* go into the repository and pull out all of the files and directories of the commit that the branch points to\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the example, if we want to switch to the *sidebar* branch, we run the command and get the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "DTI Digital@DCPVICTORPONTELLO MINGW64 ~/repos/new_git_course (master)\n",
    "git checkout sidebar\n",

    "git branch\n",
    "  master\n",
    "* sidebar\n",
    "```\n",
    "> So this will remove all of the files that are referenced by commits in the *master* branch. It will replace them with the files that are referenced by the commits in the *sidebar* branch.,\n",
    "#### Branches In The Log\n",
    "The best way to understand what is going on with the branches is to run the `git log` command, as follows:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "DTI Digital@DCPVICTORPONTELLO MINGW64 ~/repos/new_git_course (sidebar)\n",
    "git log --oneline\n",
    "6bb6943 (HEAD -> sidebar, master) ignore all the *.png files\n",
    "```\n",
    "This shows:\n",
    "1. that we are currently working on the *sidebar* branch through:\n",
    "    1. (sidebar) after the actual path\n",
    "    1. (pointer \"**HEAD ->**\" pointing to the sidebar)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. we can see the last commit and that both the master and the sidebar branches are at the same commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Delete A Branch\n",
    "If you want to delete a branch, either because you have already merged it to the master or because any other reason, the `-d` or `--delete` flag should be added to the command, like:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git branch -d sidebar\n",
    "```\n",
    "Just a quick note: if the branch is not fully merged, we have to use the flag `-D` to delete it. That's to prevent any mistake of deleting the branch accidentally.<br/><br/>\n",
    "Another quick note, we cannot delete the branch where we are currently on, first we need to checkout to another branch to be able to delete it.\n",

    "### Merging\n",
    "#### The Merge Command\n",
    "The `git merge` command is used to combine Git branches with the following code:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge <name-of-branch-to-merge-in>\n",
    "```\n",
    "When a merge happens, Git will:\n",
    "* look at the branches that it's going to merge\n",
    "* look back along the branch's history to find a single commit that both branches have in their commit history\n",
    "* combine the lines of code that were changed on the separate branches together\n",
    "* makes a commit to record the merge\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are we doing when merging\n",
    ">When we merge, we're merging some **other branch into the current (checked-out) branch**\n",
    "\n",
    ">We're not merging two branches into a new branch. We're not merging the current branch into the other branch.\n",
    "#### Fast-forward Merge\n",
    "A Fast-forward merge will just *move the currently checked out branch forward* until it points to the same commit that the other branch (in this case, footer) is pointing to.<br>\n",
    "Just to get that, let's follow the example below:\n",
    "1. First of all we run the following command to understand the branch structure of the project:\n",
    "![images/branch_structure.png](files/images/branch_structure.png)\n",
    "We can see that the branch *branching exercise* is just after the branch *footer*. There is actually an update in the same lineage of commits\n",
    "2. merge the *footer* branch by running `git merge footer`:\n",
    "![merge_footer.png](files/images/merge_footer.png)\n",
    "This shows that there are 14 insertions inside the branch `branching_exercise`\n",
    "#### Perform A Regular Merge\n",
    ">To merge in a divergent branch where two divergent branches are combined is actually no different!\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, To merge in the `sidebar` branch shown before with the `branching_exercise` branch, just be sure to be in the `branching_exercise branch` and run the command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge sidebar\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output should be like:\n",
    "![merge_sidebar.png](files/images/merge_sidebar.png)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "If we check again the branch struture of the project, by running the following command we get:\n",

    "```\n",
    "![after_merging.png](files/images/after_merging.png)\n",

    "### Sometimes Merges Fail\n",
    "Most of the time Git will be able to merge branches together without any problem. However, there are instances when a merge cannot be fully performed automatically. When a merge fails, it's called a **merge conflict**. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If a merge conflict does occur, Git will try to combine as much as it can, but then it will leave special markers (e.g. **>>>** and **<<<**) that tell you where you needs to **manually** fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Causes A Merge Conflict\n",
    ">A merge conflict will happen when the exact same line(s) are changed in separate branches\n",
    "\n",
    "As changes on the same line on both branches were done, there's no way Git will know which one you actually want to keep. Therefore we must **manually** choose.<br>\n",
    "On those cases, the output after running the `git merge` should look like:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge heading-update \n",
    "Auto-merging index.html\n",
    "CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html\n",
    "Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\n",
    "```\n",
    "On this example we are merging the branch `heading-update` to the `master` branch.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "On the text editor (VS Code) we can see the following displayed:\n",
    "![merge_conflict.PNG](files/images/merge_conflict.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Merge Conflict Indicators Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The editor has the following merge conflict indicators:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `<<<<<<< HEAD` everything below this line (until the next indicator) shows you what's on the current branch\n",
    "* `|||||||` merged common ancestors everything below this line (until the next indicator) shows you what the original lines were\n",
    "* `=======` is the end of the original lines, everything that follows (until the next indicator) is what's on the branch that's being merged in\n",
    "* `>>>>>>> heading-update` is the ending indicator of what's on the branch that's being merged in (in this case, the `heading-update` branch)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resolving A Merge Conflict\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is using the merge conflict indicators to show you what lines caused the merge conflict on the two different branches as well as what the original line used to have. So to resolve a merge conflict, you need to:\n",
    "* choose which line(s) to keep\n",
    "* remove all lines with indicators\n",
    "\n",
    ">Once you've removed all lines with merge conflict indicators and have selected what heading you want to use, just save the file, add it to the staging index, and commit it!\n",
    "\n",
    "If a merge conflict occurs in a file and you edit the file, save it, stage it, and commit it but *forget to remove the merge __conflict indicators__,*  Git will commit the lines with the merge conflict indicators! Don't forget to use `git diff` to check what's going to be staged/committed!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Merge Conflict Recap\n",
    "A merge conflict happens when the **same line** or lines have been changed on different branches that are being merged. Git will pause mid-merge telling you that there is a conflict and will tell you in what file or files the conflict occurred. To resolve the conflict in a file:\n",
    "* locate and remove all lines with merge conflict indicators\n",
    "* determine what to keep\n",
    "* save the file(s)\n",
    "* stage the file(s)\n",
    "* make a commit\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful that a file might have *merge conflicts in multiple parts of the file*, so make sure you **check the entire file** for merge conflict indicators - a quick search for `<<<` should help you locate all of them.\n",

    "You've got to be careful with Git's resetting capabilities. This is one of the few commands that lets you erase commits from the repository. If a commit is no longer in the repository, then its content is *gone*.\n",
    "> Although Git does keep track of everything for about **30 days** before it completely erases anything. To access this content, you'll need to use the `git reflog` command. Check out these links for more info:\n",

    "#### Relative Commit References\n",
    "We can reference commits by their *SHA*, by *tags*, *branches*, and the special `HEAD` pointer. But sometimes it isn't enough and we wand to refer the commit relativelly to another commit, like:\n",
    "> For example, there will be times where you'll want to tell Git about the commit that's one before the current commit...or two before the current commit.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. the parent commit ‚Äì the following indicate the parent commit of the current commit\n",
    "    * HEAD^\n",
    "    * HEAD~\n",
    "    * HEAD~1\n",

    ">üí° **Back To Normal** üí°\n",
    "If you created the `backup` branch prior to resetting anything, then you can easily get back to having the `master` branch point to the same commit as the `backup` branch. You'll just need to:\n",
    "1. remove the uncommitted changes from the working directory (if the default `--mixed` flag was used, through the `git restore` command.\n",
    "2. merge backup into master (which will cause a Fast-forward merge and move master up to the same point as backup)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reset's `--soft` Flag\n",
    "Running `git reset --soft HEAD^` will take the changes made in commit `9ec05ca` and move them directly to the *Staging Index*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reset's `--hard` Flag\n",
    "Running `git reset --hard HEAD^` will take the changes made in commit `9ec05ca` and _erases them_.\n",

    "git remote\n",
    "```\n",
    "* It's possible to have links to multiple different remote repositories.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "git push <remote-shortname> <branch>\n",
    "```\n",
    "My remote's shortname is `origin` and the commits that I want to push are on the `master` branch. So I'll use the following command to send my commits to the remote repository on GitHub:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> you can add the flag `-f` to force to push when the push is rejected. like e.g.:\n",

    "* the name of the branch that has the commits you want to send\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pull changes from a remote\n",
    "`git push` will sync the remote repository with the local repository. To do the opposite (to sync the local with the remote), we need to use `git pull`. The format for `git pull` is very similar to `git push` - you provided the shortname for the remote repository and then the name of the branch you want to pull in the commits.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git pull origin master\n",
    "```\n",

You might want to do this if there are commits on the repository that you don't have but there are also commits on the local repository that the remote one doesn't have either.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recap\n",
    "If there are changes in a remote repository that you'd like to include in your local repository, then you want to pull in those changes. To do that with Git, you'd use the `git pull` command. You tell Git the shortname of the remote you want to get the changes from and then the branch that has the changes you want:\n",

    "### Forking a Repository\n",
    "In version control terminology if you \"fork\" a repository that means you *duplicate* it. Typically you fork a repository that belongs to someone else. So you make an *identical copy* of their repository and that duplicate copy now belongs to you.<br>\n",

    "#### Stars\n",
    "Starring is helpful if you want to keep track of certain repositories, but you have to manually go to the stars page to view the repositories and see if they've changed.\n",
    "> Starring can be a useful feature to help you keep track of repositories you're interested in. But stars have also turned into a means of measuring a repo's popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Watching A Repository\n",
    "If you need to keep up with a project's changes and want to be notified of when things change or if you're working on a repository quite often, then I'd suggest setting the watch setting to \"Watching\".<br>\n",
    "This way GitHub will notify you whenever anything happens with the repository like people pushing changes to the repository, new issues being created, or comments being added to existing issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Including Upstream Changes\n",
    "If you want to keep doing development on your fork then you'd need your fork to stay in sync with the source repository as much as possible.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> `upstream` is the equivalent of the `origin` for the original repository, not the forked one.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add it to the local repository using `git remote` just like we have done with the `origin`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git remote add upstream <upstream-url>\n",
    "```\n",
    "to check the remote repos,\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# command\n",
    "git remote -v\n",
    "\n",
    "# output\n",
    "origin  https://github.com/vpontello/course-collaboration-travel-plans (fetch)\n",
    "origin  https://github.com/vpontello/course-collaboration-travel-plans (push) \n",
    "upstream        https://github.com/udacity/course-collaboration-travel-plans.git (fetch)\n",
    "upstream        https://github.com/udacity/course-collaboration-travel-plans.git (push)\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Origin vs Upstream Clarification\n",
    "\n",
    "> `origin` -> forked repo\n",
    "\n",
    "> `upstream` -> original repo\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the default names for the repos, but we can rename them if we want.\n",
    "Therefore there is the `git remote rename` command. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want to rename the `origin` to `mine` and the `upstream` to `source-repo`, we should run the following commands:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git remote rename mine origin\n",
    "git remote rename source-repo upstream\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Retrieving Upstream Changes\n",
    "Now to get the changes from *upstream* remote repository, all we have to do is run a `git fetch` and use the `upstream` shortname rather than the `origin` shortname:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git fetch upstream master\n",
    "```\n",
    "Quick note: \n",
    "> `git fetch` only updates the local repository. To update the project on GitHub, we'd need to push these newly acquired commits to our fork.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Another way of doing it is by running `git pull`, which is the same thing as a `git fetch` + `git merge`\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# to make sure I'm on the correct branch for merging\n",
    "git checkout master\n",
    "\n",
    "# merge in Lam's changes\n",
    "git merge upstream/master\n",
    "\n",
    "# send Lam's changes to *my* remote\n",
    "git push origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Recap\n",
    "When working with a project that you've forked. The original project's maintainer will continue adding changes to their project. You'll want to keep your fork of their project in sync with theirs so that you can include any changes they make.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To get commits from a source repository into your forked repository on GitHub you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* get the cloneable URL of the source repository\n",
    "* create a new remote with the `git remote add` command\n",
    "    * use the shortname `upstream` to point to the source repository\n",
    "    * provide the URL of the source repository\n",
    "* fetch the new `upstream` remote\n",
    "* merge the `upstream`'s branch into a local branch\n",
    "* push the newly updated local branch to your `origin` repo\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manage an active PR\n",
    "The project maintainer may decide not to accept your changes right away. They might request you to make some additional changes to your code before accepting your request and merging in your changes.<br>\n",
    "As simple as at may seem, working on an active pull request is mostly about communication!<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the project's maintainer is requesting changes to the pull request, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "* make any necessary commits on the same branch in your local repository that your pull request is based on\n",
    "* push the branch to the your fork of the source repository\n",
    "\n",
    "The commits will then show up on the pull request page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Squash Commits\n",
    "To squash commits together, we're going to use the extremely powerful `git rebase` command.<br>\n",
    "**quick tip**:\n",
    "> If you want to squash `n` commits, just use `HEAD~n`to rebase the commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "that sad, to squash 3 commits before the `HEAD` pointer, just run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git rebase -i HEAD~3\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### The Rebase Command\n",
    "The `git rebase` command will move commits to have a new base. In the command `git rebase -i HEAD~3`, we're telling Git to use `HEAD~3` as the base where all of the other commits (`HEAD~2`, `HEAD~1`, and `HEAD`) will connect to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-i` in the command stands for \"*interactive*\". You can perform a rebase in a non-interactive mode. While you're learning how to rebase, though, I definitely recommend that you do interactive rebasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "> sometimes it can be a little tricky to push the rebased repo to the origin. In this case the push worked just fine with the flag `-f`, to force the push.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Rebase Commands\n",
    "Let's take another look at the different commands that you can do with `git rebase`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* use `p` or `pick` ‚Äì to keep the commit as is\n",
    "* use `r` or `reword` ‚Äì to keep the commit's content but alter the commit message\n",
    "* use `e` or `edit` ‚Äì to keep the commit's content but stop before committing so that you can:\n",
    "    * add new content or files\n",
    "    * remove content or files\n",
    "    * alter the content that was going to be committed\n",
    "* use `s` or `squash` ‚Äì to combine this commit's changes into the previous commit (the commit above it in the list)\n",
    "* use `f` or `fixup` ‚Äì to combine this commit's change into the previous one but drop the commit message\n",
    "* use `x` or `exec` ‚Äì to run a shell command\n",
    "* use `d` or `drop` ‚Äì to delete the commit\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to rebase\n",
    "\n",
    "You should not rebase if you have already pushed the commits you want to rebase. If you're collaborating with other developers, then they might already be working with the commits you've pushed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recap\n",
    "The git rebase command is used to do a great many things.\n",
    "I recommend that you create a backup branch before rebasing, so that it's easy to return to your previous state. If you're happy with the rebase, then you can just delete the backup branch!\n",
