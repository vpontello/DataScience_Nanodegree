    ">While other data scientists might know how to write programs to help them manage and analyze data, having an understanding of software engineering practices will allow you to help improve processes and communicate with other stakeholders.\n",

    "#### Business managers\n",
    ">This group has in-depth knowledge of all areas of the organization you work for. They typically speak the languages of business well, know the priorities of the business strategy, and can communicate their wants, needs, and interests at a high level. But, they need a data scientist that also understands the basics of software engineering to actually implement their ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project managers\n",
    ">This group has both technical and business knowledge and knows what needs to be done. The data scientist may work with this group to help identify areas for improvements or new projects to implement.\n",
