However, others would argue that this is using comments to justify bad code, and that if code requires comments to follow, it is a sign refactoring is needed.\n",

Sometimes an unconventional or seemingly arbitrary approach may be applied because of some obscure external variable causing side effects. These things are difficult to explain with code.\n",
