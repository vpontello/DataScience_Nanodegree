# Flask Exercise Instructions

You'll find all the files you need for this exercise in the 1_flask_exercise folder. Your task is to add a new route to the routes.py file and a new html file for this route. 

From the 1_flask_exercise/worldbankapp folder, open the routes.py file and the templates folder. Follow the instructions in the TODOS. Once you've changed the files, follow these instructions to see the web app:
1. Open a Terminal
2. Enter the command `cd 1_flask_exercise` to go into the 1_flask_exercise folder.
3. Enter the command `python worldbank.py`
4. Click 'PREVIEW' button to open the homepage

In the workspace, you'll also see a folder called solutions. Inside the solutions folder is another folder called 1_flask_exercise, which contains an example solution.
