    "#### HTML Document Example\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "    <title>Page Title</title>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "\n",

    "    <h1>A Photo of a Beautiful Landscape</h1>\n",
    "    <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp\">HTML tags</a>\n",
    "    <p>Here is the photo</p>\n",
    "    <img src=\"photo.jpg\" alt=\"Country Landscape\">\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you progress through the lesson, you'll find that the `<head>` tag is mostly for housekeeping like specifying the page title and adding meta tags. Meta tags are in essence information about the page that web crawlers see but users do not. The head tag also contains links to javascript and css files, which you'll see later in the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "The website content goes in the `<body>` tag. The body tag can contain headers, paragraphs, images, links, forms, lists, and a handful of other tags. Of particular note in this example are the link tag `<a>` and the image tag `<img>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these tags link to external information outside of the html doc. In the html code above, the link `<a>` tag links to an external website called w3schools. The href is called an attribute, and in this case href specifies the link.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image `<img>` tag displays an image called \"photo.jpg\". In this case, the jpg file and the html document are in the same directory, but the documents do not have to be. The src attribute specifies the path to the image file relative to the html document. The alt tag contains text that gets displaced in case the image cannot be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Full List of Tags and How to Use Them**\n",
    "This is a link to one of the best references for html. Use this website to look up html tags and how to use them. [W3Schools HTML Tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking your HTML\n",
    "It's a good idea to check the validity of your HTML. Here is a website that checks your HTML for syntax errors: [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input). Try pasting your HTML code here and running the validator. You can read through the error messages and fix your HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Div and Span\n",
    "* **DIV** statements are used to link multiple content elements together (for placement or styling)\n",
    "* **SPAN** tags are meant to separate a small piece of content.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use div elements to split off large chunks of html into sections. Span elements, on the other hand, are for small chunks of html. You generally use span elements in the middle of a piece of text in order to apply a specific style to that text. You'll see how this works a bit later in the CSS portion of the lesson.\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div>\n",

    "### CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS stands for cascading style sheets. The \"cascading\" refers to how rules trickle down to the various layers of an html tree. For example, you might specify that all paragraphs have the same font type. But then you want to override one of the paragraphs to have a different font type. How does a browser decide which rules apply when there is a conflict? That's based on the cascade over. You can read more about that [here](https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-cascade-mean-3466872).\n",
    "\n",
    "In most professional websites, css is kept in a separate stylesheet. This makes it easier to separate content (html) from style (css). Code becomes easier to read and maintain.\n",

    "#### CSS Rules and Syntax\n",
    "CSS is essentially a set of rules that you can use to stylize html. The [W3 Schools CSS Website](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) is a good place to find all the different rules you can use. These including styling text, links, margins, padding, image, icons and background colors among other options.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [CSS References](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax is that you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. select the html element, id, and/or class of interest\n",
    "2. specify what you want to change about the element\n",
    "3. specify a value, followed by a semi-colon\n",
    "\n",
    "For example\n",
    "```css\n",
    "a {\n",
    "  text-decoration:none;\n",
    "  color:blue;\n",
    "  font-weight:bold;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "To select by class, you use a dot like so:\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".class_name {\n",
    "   color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "To select by id name, you use the pound sign:\n",
    "```css\n",
    "#id_name {\n",
    "  color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can make more complex selections as well like \"select paragraphs inside the div with id \"div_top\" . If your html looks like this,\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div id=\"div_top\">\n",
    "   <p>This is a paragraph</p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "then the CSS would be like this:\n",
    "```css\n",
    "div#div_top p {\n",
    "  color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### Margins and Padding\n",
    "The difference between margin and padding is a bit tricky. Margin rules specify a spatial buffer on the outside of an element. Padding specifies an internal spatial buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "![margins_and_padding](images/css_margin_and_padding.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifying Size: Pixels versus Percent versus EM Units\n",
    "In CSS there are various ways to define sizes, widths, and heights. The three main ones are pixels, percentages, and em units.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use px, you're defining the exact number of pixels an element should use in terms of size. So\n",
    "```css\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "means the font-size will be exactly 12 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The percent and em units have a similar function. They dynamically change sizing based on a browser's default values. For example\n",
    "```css\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 100%\"> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "means to use the default browser font size. 150% would be 1.5 times the default font size. 50% would be half. Similarly, 1em unit would be 1 x default_font. So 2em would be 2 x default font, etc. The advantage of using percents and em is that your web pages become dynamic. The document adapts to the default settings of whatever device someone is using be that a desktop, laptop or mobile phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, percentages and em units are actually calculating sizes relative to parent elements in the html tree. For example, if you specify a font size in a body tag , then the percentages will be relative to the body element:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "<body style=\"font-size: 20px\">\n",
    "    <p style=\"font-size:80%\">This is a paragraph</p>\n",
    "...\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because different browsers might render html and CSS differently, there isn't necessarily a right or wrong way to specify sizes. This will depend on who will use your website and on what type of devices. You can read more here. You won't need to worry about all of this because in the web app, you're going to use a CSS framework that takes care of all of this for you.\n",

    "### JavaScript\n",
    "#### What is JavaScript?\n",
    "* JavaScript is a high level language like Python, PHP, Ruby, and C++. It was specifically developed to make the front-end of a web application more dynamic; however, you can also use javascript to program the back-end of a website with the JavaScript runtime environment node.\n",

    "* JavaScript syntax, especially for front-end web development, is a bit tricky. It's much easier to write front-end JavaScript code using a framework such as jQuery.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic JavaScript Syntax\n",
    "Here are a few rules to keep in mind when writing JavaScript:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a line of code ends with a semi-colon ;\n",
    "* () parenthesis are used when calling a function much like in Python\n",
    "* {} curly braces surround large chunks of code or are used when initializing dictionaries\n",

    "## Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "When you type http://www.udacity.com into a browser, your computer sends out a request to another computer (ie the server) where the Udacity website is stored. Then the Udacity server sends you the files needed to render the website in your browser. The Udacity computer is called a server because it \"serves\" you the files that you requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTTP part of the web address stands for Hypter-text Transfer Protocol. HTTP defines a standard way of sending and receiving messages over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you hit enter in your browser, your computer says \"get me the files for the web page at www.udacity.com\": except that message is sent to the server with the syntax governed by HTTP. Then the server sends out the files via the protocol as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "There needs to be some software on the server that can interpret these HTTP requests and send out the correct files. That's where a web framework like Flask comes into play. A framework abstracts the code for receiving requests as well as interpreting the requests and sending out the correct files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Flask?\n",
    "* First and foremost, you'll be working with Flask because it is written in Python. You won't need to learn a new programming language.\n",
    "* Flask is also a relatively simple framework, so it's good for making a small web app.\n",
    "* Because Flask is written in Python, you can use Flask with any other Python library including pandas, numpy and scikit-learn. In this lesson, you'll be deploying a data dashboard and pandas will help get the data ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating New Pages\n",
    "To create a new web page, you first need to specify the route in the routes.py as well as the name of the html template.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route('/new-route')\n",
    "def render_the_route():\n",
    "    return render_template('new_route.html')\n",
    "```\n",
    "The route name, function name, and template name do not have to match; however, it's good practice to make them similar so that the code is easier to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new_route.html file must go in the templates folder. Flask automatically looks for html files in the templates folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is @app.route?\n",
    "To use Flask, you don't necessarily need to know what `@app.route` is doing. You only have to remember that the path you place inside of `@app.route()` will be the web address. And then the function you write below @app.route is used to render the correct html template file for the web address.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `@` symbol is used for `decorators`. Decorators are a shorthand way to input a function into another function. Take a look at this code. Python allows you to use a function as an input to another function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def decorator(input_function):\n",
    "\n",
    "    return input_function\n",
    "\n",
    "def input_function():\n",
    "    print(\"I am an input function\")\n",
    "\n",
    "decorator_example = decorator(input_function)\n",
    "decorator_example()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Running this code will print the string:\n",
    "\n",
    "*I am an input function*\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators provide a short-hand way of getting the same behavior:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def decorator(input_function):\n",
    "    print(\"Decorator function\")\n",
    "    return input_function\n",
    "\n",
    "@decorator\n",
    "def input_function():\n",
    "    print(\"I am an input function\")\n",
    "\n",
    "input_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code will print out:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Decorator function**I am an input function*\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using a decorator function, you could get the same behavior with the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "input_function = decorator(input_function)\n",
    "input_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Because `@app.route()`has the `@` symbol, there's an implication that app is a class (or an instance of a class) and route is a method of that class. Hence a function written underneath `@app.route()` is going to get passed into the route method. The purpose of `@app.route()` is to make sure the correct web address gets associated with the correct html template. This code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route('/homepage')\n",
    "def some_function()\n",
    "  return render_template('index.html')\n",
    "```\n",
    "is ensuring that the web address `www.website.com/homepage` is associated with the `index.html` template.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Flask+Plotly+Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary Part 1\n",
    "The data set was sent from the back end to the front end. This was accomplished by including a variable in the render_template() function like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = data_wrangling()\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "@app.route('/index')\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "   return render_template('index.html', data_set = data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "What this code does is to first load the data using the data_wrangling function from wrangling.py. This data gets stored in a variable called data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In render_template, that data is sent to the front end via a variable called data_set. Now the data is available to the front_end in the data_set variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `index.html` file, you can access the data_set variable using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "{{ data_set }}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can do this because Flask comes with a template engine called [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/). Jinja also allows you to put control flow statements in your html using the following syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{% for tuple in data_set %}\n",
    "  <p>{{tuple}}</p>\n",
    "{% end_for %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The logic is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Wrangle data in a file (aka Python module). In this case, the file is called wrangling.py. The wrangling.py has a function that returns the clean data.\n",
    "2. Execute this function in routes.py to get the data in routes.py\n",
    "3. Pass the data to the front-end (index.html file) using the render_template method.\n",
    "4. Inside of index.html, you can access the data variable with the squiggly bracket syntax {{ }}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part, a Plotly visualization was set up on the back-end inside the routes.py file using Plotly's Python library. The Python plotly code is a dictionary of dictionaries. The Python dictionary is then converted to a JSON format and sent to the front-end via the render_templates method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simultaneously a list of ids are created for the plots. This information is also sent to the front-end using the render_template() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the front-end, the ids and visualization code (JSON code) is then used with the Plotly javascript library to render the plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python is used to set up a Plotly visualization\n",
    "2. An id is created associated with each visualization\n",
    "3. The Python Plotly code is converted to JSON\n",
    "4. The ids and JSON are sent to the front end (index.html).\n",
    "5. The front end then uses the ids, JSON, and JavaScript Plotly library to render the plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary Part 3\n",
    "In part 3, the code iterated through the data set to create a visualization with multiple lines: one for each country.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original code for a line chart with a single line was:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "graph_one = [go.Scatter(\n",
    "  x = data[0][1],\n",
    "  y = data[0][2],\n",
    "  mode = 'lines',\n",
    "  name = country\n",
    ")]\n",
    "```\n",
    "To make a visualization with multiple lines, graph_one will be a list of line charts. This was accomplished with the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "graph_one = []\n",
    "for data_tuple in data:\n",
    "   graph_one.append(go.Scatter(\n",
    "   x = data_tuple[1],\n",
    "   y = data_tuple[2],\n",
    "   mode = 'lines',\n",
    "   name = data_tuple[0]\n",
    "))\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Summary Part 4\n",
    "In the last part, three more visualizations were added to the wrangling Python module. The wrangling included reading in the data, cleaning the data, and preparing the Plotly code. Each visualization's code was appended to a list called figures. These visualizations were then imported into the routes.py file. This figures list was sent from the back end to the front end via the render_template method. A list of ids were also sent from the back end to the front end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then on the front end (index.html), a div was created for each visualization's id. And with help from the JavaScript Plotly library, each visualization was rendered inside appropriate div.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beyond a CSV file\n",
    "Besides storing data in a local csv file (or text, json, etc.), you could also store the data in a database such as a SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database could be local to your website meaning that the database file is stored on the same server as your website; alternatively, the database could be stored somewhere else like on a separate database server or with a cloud service like Amazon AWS.\n",

    "\n",
    "Then open the Procfile and type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "web gunicorn worldbank:app\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. [Applicable only for the Local practice. Not for the workspace.] Create a requirements.txt file, which lists all of the Python packages that your app depends on:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For workspace users, the requirements.txt is already available in the exercise folder. In addition, we have also provided a runtime.txt file in the exercise folder, that declares the exact Python version number to use. Heroku supports these Python runtimes.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "# Run it just once, in the beginning\n",
    "git init\n",
    "# For the first time commit, you need to configure the git username and email:\n",

    "git add .\n",
    "# Check which files are ready to be committed\n",
    "git status\n",
    "git commit -m \"your message\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "7. Now, create a Heroku app:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "git remote -v\n",
    "```\n",
    "8. Before you finally push your local git repository to the remote Heroku repository, you will need the following environment variables (kind of secrets) to send along:\n",

    "# Set any environment variable to pass along with the push\n",
    "heroku config:set SLUGIFY_USES_TEXT_UNIDECODE=yes\n",
    "heroku config:set AIRFLOW_GPL_UNIDECODE=yes\n",
    "# Verify the variables\n",
    "heroku config\n",
    "```\n",
    "If your code uses any confidential variable value, you can use this approach to send those values secretly. These values will not be visible to the public users. Now, push your local repo to the remote Heroku repo:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Syntax\n",
    "# git push <remote branch name> <local branch name>\n",
    "git push heroku master\n",
    "```\n",
    "Other useful commands are:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Clear the build cache\n",
    "heroku plugins:install heroku-builds\n",
    "heroku builds:cache:purge -a <app-name> --confirm <app-name>\n",
    "# Permanently delete the app\n",
    "heroku apps:destroy  <app-name> --confirm <app-name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, you can type your web app's address, such as https://sudkul-web-app.herokuapp.com/, in the browser to see the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Services Besides Heroku\n",
    "Heroku is just one option of many for deploying a web app, and Heroku is actually owned by [Salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The big internet companies offer similar services like Amazon's Lightsail, Microsoft's Azure, Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud (formerly IBM Bluemix). However, these services tend to require more configuration. Most of these also come with either a free tier or a limited free tier that expires after a certain amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Virtual Environments vs. Anaconda\n",
    "Virtual environments and Anaconda serve a very similar purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Anaconda is a distribution of Python (and the analytics language R) specifically for data science. Anaconda comes installed with a package and environment manager called conda.\n",
    "* To ensure that your app only installs necessary packages, you should create a virtual Python environment. A virtual Python environment is a separate Python installation on your computer that you can easily remove and won't interfere with your main Python installation. You can create separate environments using conda. These environments automatically come with default Python packages meant for data science. However, there can be additional packages that you'd want to install in the new environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "When deploying a web app to a server, you should only include the necessary packages for running your web app. Otherwise, you'd be installing Python packages that you don't need. We have already provided the package list in the requirements.txt in the workspace above. However, you can create one yourself using the `pip freeze > requirements.txt` command from the new environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a Virtual Environment Locally on Your Computer\n",
    "You can develop your app using the classroom workspace. If you decide to develop your app locally on your computer, you should set up a virtual environment there as well. Different versions of Python have different ways of setting up virtual environments. The env command allows us to create lightweight virtual environments :\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Optional - Update Python installation\n",
    "conda update python\n",
    "# Create a virtual environment\n",
    "python3 -m venv myenv\n",
    "# Activate the new environment\n",
    "source myenv/bin/activate\n",
    "# The new environment will automatically come with Python packages meant for data science.\n",
    "```\n",
    "On Windows, the command is;\n",

    "> py -3 -m venv myvenv\n",
    "> myvenv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n",
    "For more information, read through this link.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Databases for Your App\n",
    "The web app in this lesson does not need a database. All of the data is stored in CSV files; however, it is possible to include a database as part of a Flask app. One common use case would be to store user login information such as username and password.\n",
