    "### HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTML Document Example\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "    <title>Page Title</title>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "    <h1>A Photo of a Beautiful Landscape</h1>\n",
    "    <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp\">HTML tags</a>\n",
    "    <p>Here is the photo</p>\n",
    "    <img src=\"photo.jpg\" alt=\"Country Landscape\">\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you progress through the lesson, you'll find that the `<head>` tag is mostly for housekeeping like specifying the page title and adding meta tags. Meta tags are in essence information about the page that web crawlers see but users do not. The head tag also contains links to javascript and css files, which you'll see later in the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "The website content goes in the `<body>` tag. The body tag can contain headers, paragraphs, images, links, forms, lists, and a handful of other tags. Of particular note in this example are the link tag `<a>` and the image tag `<img>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these tags link to external information outside of the html doc. In the html code above, the link `<a>` tag links to an external website called w3schools. The href is called an attribute, and in this case href specifies the link.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image `<img>` tag displays an image called \"photo.jpg\". In this case, the jpg file and the html document are in the same directory, but the documents do not have to be. The src attribute specifies the path to the image file relative to the html document. The alt tag contains text that gets displaced in case the image cannot be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Full List of Tags and How to Use Them**\n",
    "This is a link to one of the best references for html. Use this website to look up html tags and how to use them. [W3Schools HTML Tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking your HTML\n",
    "It's a good idea to check the validity of your HTML. Here is a website that checks your HTML for syntax errors: [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input). Try pasting your HTML code here and running the validator. You can read through the error messages and fix your HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Div and Span\n",
    "* **DIV** statements are used to link multiple content elements together (for placement or styling)\n",
    "* **SPAN** tags are meant to separate a small piece of content.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use div elements to split off large chunks of html into sections. Span elements, on the other hand, are for small chunks of html. You generally use span elements in the middle of a piece of text in order to apply a specific style to that text. You'll see how this works a bit later in the CSS portion of the lesson.\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "   <p>This is an example of when to use a div elements versus a span element. A span element goes around <span>a small chunk of html</span></p>\n",
    "</div>\n",

    "#### IDs and Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Getting the HTML ready for CSS\n",
    "HTML has attributes specifically for differentiating elements from each other, the ID attribute and the class attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The ID attribute:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uniquely identify a piece of content\n",
    "* Should only be used once per HTML page\n",
    "* IDs can go in any tag\n",
    "* Elements can only have one id\n",
    "\n",
    "**The class attribute:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Groups multiple pieces of content together\n",
    "* Class names can be used multiple times in an HTML page\n",
    "* Elements can have more than one class\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding IDs and classes will allow for more control over CSS styling. They help you add style to your pages in a logical, organized way.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example HTML Using IDs and classes\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div id=\"top\">\n",

    "### CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS stands for cascading style sheets. The \"cascading\" refers to how rules trickle down to the various layers of an html tree. For example, you might specify that all paragraphs have the same font type. But then you want to override one of the paragraphs to have a different font type. How does a browser decide which rules apply when there is a conflict? That's based on the cascade over. You can read more about that [here](https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-cascade-mean-3466872).\n",
    "\n",
    "In most professional websites, css is kept in a separate stylesheet. This makes it easier to separate content (html) from style (css). Code becomes easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CSS styling\n",
    "CSS lets us separate content from styling by applying styling to elements on the screen\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",

    "<style>\n",
    "\n",
    "#p_top {\n",

    "<head>\n",
    "    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type\"text/css\" href=\"style.css\">\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### CSS Rules and Syntax\n",
    "CSS is essentially a set of rules that you can use to stylize html. The [W3 Schools CSS Website](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) is a good place to find all the different rules you can use. These including styling text, links, margins, padding, image, icons and background colors among other options.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax is that you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. select the html element, id, and/or class of interest\n",
    "2. specify what you want to change about the element\n",
    "3. specify a value, followed by a semi-colon\n",
    "\n",
    "For example\n",
    "```css\n",
    "a {\n",
    "  text-decoration:none;\n",
    "  color:blue;\n",
    "  font-weight:bold;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "To select by class, you use a dot like so:\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".class_name {\n",
    "   color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "To select by id name, you use the pound sign:\n",
    "```css\n",
    "#id_name {\n",
    "  color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can make more complex selections as well like \"select paragraphs inside the div with id \"div_top\" . If your html looks like this,\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div id=\"div_top\">\n",
    "   <p>This is a paragraph</p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "then the CSS would be like this:\n",
    "```css\n",
    "div#div_top p {\n",
    "  color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### Margins and Padding\n",
    "The difference between margin and padding is a bit tricky. Margin rules specify a spatial buffer on the outside of an element. Padding specifies an internal spatial buffer.\n",
    "![margins_and_padding](images/css_margin_and_padding.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifying Size: Pixels versus Percent versus EM Units\n",
    "In CSS there are various ways to define sizes, widths, and heights. The three main ones are pixels, percentages, and em units.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use px, you're defining the exact number of pixels an element should use in terms of size. So\n",
    "```css\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "means the font-size will be exactly 12 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The percent and em units have a similar function. They dynamically change sizing based on a browser's default values. For example\n",
    "```css\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 100%\"> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "means to use the default browser font size. 150% would be 1.5 times the default font size. 50% would be half. Similarly, 1em unit would be 1 x default_font. So 2em would be 2 x default font, etc. The advantage of using percents and em is that your web pages become dynamic. The document adapts to the default settings of whatever device someone is using be that a desktop, laptop or mobile phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, percentages and em units are actually calculating sizes relative to parent elements in the html tree. For example, if you specify a font size in a body tag , then the percentages will be relative to the body element:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "<body style=\"font-size: 20px\">\n",
    "    <p style=\"font-size:80%\">This is a paragraph</p>\n",
    "...\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because different browsers might render html and CSS differently, there isn't necessarily a right or wrong way to specify sizes. This will depend on who will use your website and on what type of devices. You can read more here. You won't need to worry about all of this because in the web app, you're going to use a CSS framework that takes care of all of this for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further Learning and Resources\n",
