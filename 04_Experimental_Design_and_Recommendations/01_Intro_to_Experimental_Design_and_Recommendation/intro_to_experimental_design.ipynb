    "Completion of this course will help you understand the role that experiment design and testing can play in product design and development, as well as give you a solid background in the different types of recommendations that can be provided, how recommendation engines work, and how you can evaluate the quality of a recommendation engine.\n",

    "Experimental design has many stakeholders, including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Researchers**\n",
    "    * Any time organizations are involved in actual experimenting, it is vital that proper protocol, best practice, and standard procedures are followed. This ensures privacy as well as reliability of data.\n",
    "* **Data scientists**\n",
    "    * Data scientists that collect data need to understand experiment design, including the most appropriate type of experiment or study to conduct based on their needs, evaluating the quality of an experiment, and also account for and mitigate biases in both the design of the experiment and also the collection of data.\n",
    "* **Customers**\n",
    "    * Most e-commerce sites are involved in A/B testing in order to try out new products, ideas, or interfaces. Organizations that implement professional and ethical experiments develop trust with their customers. Customers that have good experiences when interacting online with a company help build that rapport. Additionally, for companies that deal with recommendations (e.g. video streaming, product sales, or referrals), having accurate and helpful recommendations is vital to the customer experience.\n",
    "* **eCommerce purchasing**\n",
    "    * Teams supporting eCommerce will be able to evaluate a product or assess the data that has been collected related to a specific product.\n",
    "* **Marketing/Advertising**\n",
    "    * Marketers and advertisers base their short-term and long-term customer-facing initiatives on anticipated customer behavior and activity. Properly implemented experiments can generate powerful data to helps direct these initiatives.\n",

    "> *There is no single experiment or test that always works, it is case by case.*\n",

    "* Control groups\n",
    "\n",
    "How to determine when the experiment has completed?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decide 1 or 2 'decision metrics' and the thresholds that are flags\n",
    "* Make sure you have collected enough data to analyze or make a recommendation\n",
    "* Decide how long to run the experiment in order to collect appropriate data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is next after the experiment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Product teams tend to run these experiments, but data scientists implement the actual experiment. Product team leaders will use the analysis and recommendation to make business decisions.\n",

    "* **How do you decide what to test?**\n",
    "    * Depends on the priorities of marketing partners. Some requests are major, some are minor. We also ask if it affects operations and customers?\n",
    "* **What do you think about when approaching a new test?**\n",
    "    * You have to manage and understand all the various types of data coming in\n",
    "    * How can we measure experiments to determine if an idea worked or not\n",
    "* **Do most projects succeed?**\n",
    "    * Most experiments fail, otherwise, we would already be doing it\n",
    "    * Data science helps organizations uncover the less obvious\n",
    "    * In many cases, the results of testing are little, or none at all. change. Even positive results still have balance the cost vs. benefit to implementing at scale\n",
    "* **How do you ensure control and test groups are compatible?**\n",
    "    * Be aware of past customer behavior based on treatment history or time of year,\n"
