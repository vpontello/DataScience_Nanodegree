    "Let's say that you're working for a fictional productivity software company that is looking for ways to increase the number of people who pay for their software. The way that the software is currently set up, users can download and use the software free of charge, for a 7-day trial. After the end of the trial, users are required to pay for a license to continue using the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "One idea that the company wants to try is to change the layout of the homepage to emphasize more prominently and higher up on the page that there is a 7-day trial available for the company's software. The current fear is that some potential users are missing out on using the software because of a lack of awareness of the trial period. If more people download the software and use it in the trial period, the hope is that this entices more people to make a purchase after seeing what the software can do.\n"
