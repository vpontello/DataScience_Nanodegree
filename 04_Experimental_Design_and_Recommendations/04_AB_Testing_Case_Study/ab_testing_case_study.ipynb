    "\n",
    "Let's say that you're working for a fictional productivity software company that is looking for ways to increase the number of people who pay for their software. The way that the software is currently set up, users can download and use the software free of charge, for a 7-day trial. After the end of the trial, users are required to pay for a license to continue using the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "One idea that the company wants to try is to change the layout of the homepage to emphasize more prominently and higher up on the page that there is a 7-day trial available for the company's software. The current fear is that some potential users are missing out on using the software because of a lack of awareness of the trial period. If more people download the software and use it in the trial period, the hope is that this entices more people to make a purchase after seeing what the software can do.\n"

    "## Building a Funnel\n",
    "Before we do anything else, the first thing we should do is specify the objective or goal of our study:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Revising the structure of the homepage will increase the number of people\n",
    "that download the software and, ultimately, the number of people that purchase\n",
    "a license.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we should think about the activities that a user will take on the site that are relevant to measuring our objective. This path or funnel will help us figure out how we will create experimental condition groups and which metrics we'll need to track to measure the experiment's effect. To help you construct the funnel, here's some information about the way the company's website is structured, and how the software induces users to purchase a license.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company's website has five main sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the homepage;\n",
    "1. a section with additional information, gallery, and examples;\n",
    "2. a page for users to download the software;\n",
    "3. a page for users to purchase a license; and\n",
    "4. a support sub-site with documentation and FAQs for the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the software itself, the website requires that users create an account in order to download the software program. The program is usable freely for seven days after download. When the trial period is hit, the program will bring up a dialog box that takes the user to the license page. After purchasing a license, the user will receive a unique code associated with their site account. This code can then be used with the program to register it with that user, and the program can be used thereafter without issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a Funnel Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "> What steps do you expect typical visitors to take from their initial visit to the webpage through purchasing a license for continued use of the program? Are there any 'typical' steps that certain visitors might not take?\n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward flow might include the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visit homepage\n",
    "* Visit download page\n",
    "* Sign up for an account\n",
    "* Download software\n",
    "* After the 7-day trial, the software takes the user to a license-purchase page\n",
    "* Purchase license\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is possible for the visitor to drop from the flow after each step, forming a funnel. There might be additional steps that a user might take between visiting the homepage and visiting the download page that isn't accounted for in the above flow. For example, someone might want to check out the additional informational pages before visiting the download page, or even visit the license purchase page to check the license price before even deciding to download. Considering the amount of browsing that a visitor could perform on the page, it might be simplest just to track whether or not a user gets to the download page at some point, without worrying about the many paths that they could have taken to get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Consider the webpage as a whole. What kinds of events might occur outside of the expected flow for the experiment that might interfere with measuring the effects of our manipulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few events in the expected flow that might not correspond with the visitors we want to target. For example, there might be users on the homepage who aren't new users. Users who already have a license might just be visiting the homepage as a way to access the support sub-site. A user who wants to buy a license might also come into the license page through the homepage, rather than directly from the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to license purchasing, it's possible that users don't come back after exactly seven days. Some users might come back early and make their purchase during their trial period. Alternatively, a user might end up taking more than seven days to decide to make their purchase, coming back days after the end of the trial. Anticipating scenarios like this can be useful for planning the design, and coming up with metrics that come as close as possible to measuring desired effects.\n",

    "## Deciding on Metrics\n",
    "From our user funnel, we should consider two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "Where and how we should split users into experiment groups\n",
    "What metrics we will use to track the success or failure of the experimental manipulation.\n",
    "The choice of unit of diversion (the point at which we divide observations into groups) may affect what metrics we can use, and whether the metrics we record should be considered invariant or evaluation metrics. To start, decide on a unit of diversion and brainstorm some ideas for metrics to capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, the overall plan is to test the effect of the new homepage using a true experiment; in particular, we'll be using an A/B testing framework. This means that prospective users should be split into two groups. The control, or 'A' group, will see the old homepage, while the experimental, or 'B' group, will see the new homepage that emphasizes the 7-day trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categories of diversion\n",
    "Three main categories of diversion were presented in the course: event-based diversion, cookie-based diversion, and account-based diversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An **event-based** diversion (like a pageview) can provide many observations to draw conclusions from but doesn't quite hit the mark for this case. If the condition changes on each pageview, then a visitor might get a different experience on each homepage visit. Event-based diversion is much better when the changes aren't as easily visible to users, to avoid disruption of experience. In addition, page view-based diversion would let us know how many times the download page was accessed from each condition, but can't go any further in tracking how many actual downloads were generated from each condition.\n",
    "* Diverting based on **account or user ID** can be stable, but it's not the right choice in this case. Since visitors only register after getting to the download page, this is too late to introduce the new homepage to people who should be assigned to the experimental condition.\n",
    "* So this leaves the consideration of **cookie-based** diversion, which feels like the right choice. We can assign a cookie to each visitor upon their first-page hit, which allows them to be separated into the control and experimental groups. Cookies also allow tracking of each visitor hitting each page, recording whether or not they eventually hit the download page and then whether or not they actually register an account and perform the download. That's not to say that the cookie-based diversion is perfect. The usual cookie-based diversion issues apply: we can get some inconsistency in counts if users enter the site via an incognito window, different browsers, or cookies that expire or get deleted before they make a download. This kind of assignment 'dilution' could dampen the true effect of our experimental manipulation. As a simplification, however, we'll assume that this kind of assignment dilution will be small, and ignore its potential effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A cookie-based diversion seems best in this case for dividing visitors into experimental groups since we can split visitors on their initial visit and it's fairly reliable for tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key metrics\n",
    "In terms of metrics, we might want to keep track of the number of cookies that are recorded in different parts of the website. In particular, the number of cookies on the homepage, download page, and account registration page (in order to actually make the download) could prove useful. We can track the number of licenses purchased through the user accounts, each of which can be linked back to a particular condition. Though it hasn't been specified, it's also possible that the software includes usage statistics that we could track.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above metrics are all based on absolute counts. We could instead perform our analysis on ratios of those counts. For example, we could be interested in the proportion of downloads out of all homepage visits. License purchases could be stated as a ratio against the number of registered users (downloads) or the original number of cookies."
