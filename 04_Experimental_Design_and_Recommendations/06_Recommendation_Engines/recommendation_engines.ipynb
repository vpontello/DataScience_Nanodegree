    "## Types of Recommendation Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three methods that you have now implemented for making recommendations. These are the three most recognized methods in the industry:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Knowledge-Based Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge-based recommendations frequently are implemented using filters and are extremely common amongst luxury-based goods. Filters that you might see when purchasing items like cars or homes are examples of knowledge-based recommendations. In knowledge-based recommendations, users provide information about the types of recommendations they would like back.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering uses the connections between users and items to make recommendations. Even the content-based recommendation you just implemented used some collaborative filtering techniques, as you were not treating items and users independently from one another. In this lesson, you used neighborhood-based collaborative filtering to find users who were alike and then recommend new movies based on these similar users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in the content-based recommendation, you were using collaborative filtering. You were finding items that were similar and making recommendations of new items based on the highest ratings of a user. Because you were still using the user ratings of an item, this was an example of a blend between content and collaborative filtering-based techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Content-Based Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, you created a matrix of similarities between items (movies) based only on the content related to those movies (year and genre). The similarity matrix that was used, was completely created using only the items (movies). There was no information used about the users. For any movie, you would be able to determine the most related additional movies based only on the genre and the year of the movie. This is the premise of how a completely content-based recommendation would be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often blended techniques of all three types are used in practice to provide the best recommendation for a particular circumstance.\n",
    "\n"

    "### Movie Tweetings\n",
    "We'll be working with the MovieTweetings data, a movie rating dataset collected by Simon Dooms using Twitter. You'll learn standard techniques for creating recommendations as you work with this data. As you build each recommendation, think about the pros and cons and how you might improve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like additional information about the MovieTweetings data, you can find more information at the links provided here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [A Github account set up for MovieTweetings](https://github.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings): MovieTweetings is a dataset consisting of ratings on movies contained in well-structured tweets on Twitter.\n",

    "*Notes: due to the large size of the original datasets relative to the memory, we will use reduced datasets in Jupyter Notebook exercises within the \"Introduction to Recommendation Engines\" and \"Matrix Factorization for Recommendations\" lessons.*"

    "## Ways to Recommend: Knowledge Based\n",
    "\n",
    "A knowledge-based recommendation is one in which knowledge about the item or user preferences is used to make a recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge-based recommendations are pretty common when purchasing luxury items. Take a look at the filters available on Zillow in the image below. This is an example of building in a knowledge-based recommendation, as users can add their own preferences to the items that are provided.\n",
    "\n",
